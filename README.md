## Integrating a web-3 wallet

```
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
```

There is an Escrow.sol contract that allows users to deposit, and allows the owner to withdraw the total balance.

1.) Deploy the contract (needs deployment functionality) 
2.) Both the contract and the app need unit tests

Complete the tasks above, then integrate this repo into timmchale.co

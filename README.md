## Integrating a web-3 wallet

```
npm init @rainbow-me/rainbowkit@latest
```

I want to extend wallet functionallity in the following ways

1.) Create a contract
2.) The contract must have a staking feature, a minimum week long waiting period, then an additional signature is required, before the owner (Tim) can withdraw the money put up  
2.) Deploy the contract (needs deployment functionality) 
3.) Both the contract and the app need unit tests

Complete the tasks above, then integrate this repo into timmchale.co
